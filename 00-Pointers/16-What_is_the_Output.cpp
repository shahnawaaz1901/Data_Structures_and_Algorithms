1. 10 21                                    // Correct
2. 11 20
3. 11 21
4. 10 20
Solution Description : p points to a. q points to p directly and a through p (double pointer). 
                    *q â€” value stored in p is changed to address of b instead of that of a. 
                    (*p)++ â€” value that p points to, which now is of b, is incremented by 1 
                    (b becomes 21). Value of a remains unchanged.

3. 101 105
4. 100 105
Solution Description :
1. int a = 100; sets the value of a to be 100.

2. int *p = &a; creates a pointer p pointing to the address of a.

3. int **q = &p; creates a pointer-to-pointer q pointing to the address of p.

4. int b = (**q)++ + 4; dereferences q twice to get the value of a (100), increments it by 1, 
    and adds 4, resulting in 104. The value of a becomes 101.

5. cout << a << " " << b << endl; prints the values of a and b, which are 101 and 104, 
    respectively.

3. Error
4. None of these
Solution Description :
1. 'num' is initialized with the value 10.

2. 'ptr' is a pointer that stores the address of 'num'.

3. 'increment' function takes a double pointer as an argument, so '&ptr' is passed.

4. Inside the 'increment' function, '**p' refers to the value of 'num', which is incremented by 1.

5. After the function call, the value of 'num' becomes 11.
